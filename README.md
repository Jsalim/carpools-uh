Introduction
--------------

This system is meant to create a carpool system for the University of Hawaii faculty and student body. It is meant to be a safe and easy to use system that will only allow people within the UH system to create carpools to the UH campus. The alternate purpose is to help reduce traffic and make commuting to UH a safer and more comfortable experience.
